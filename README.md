## **Flashcard Vocab App**

+ We want to use a dictionary/thesaurus API to search for a word the client wants to learn more about and generate a flashcard for continued learning.
Even english majors run into words they donâ€™t know on a daily basis. This app will help continued learning to strengthen the users vocabulary and understanding of the english language with fun game-like flashcards. 

+ **MVP -** At the very least, we want to save searched words into a database and have corresponding flash cards to quiz the user on demand. 
Then incorporate a translation API to teach that word in other languages. 
  + We will also utilize a quote generator API to bring in quotes that contain the searched word. 
  + We will also use an Owlbot API to generate photos for the searched word.
  + Stretch goals - 
  + Point system tied to an individual user - the more you quiz and succeed the more points you get! 
  + Leader board to go with the point system?
  + Flip animations for the flash-cards
  + Responsive Web Design for phone-laptop-tablet usability 
  + Incorporate audio files into the flashcard so you can HEAR how to properly pronounce the word too!
  + Google translate link somewhere /Google translate API 
  + Functionality to edit the flashcard to incorporate your preferred acronym/synonym etc.
